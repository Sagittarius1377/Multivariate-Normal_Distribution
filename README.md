# 📊 Multivariate-Normal_Distribution

This repository demonstrates **Normal** and **Multivariate Normal distributions** using Python. It provides practical examples of generating, analyzing, and visualizing data, suitable for understanding fundamental statistical concepts in real-world scenarios.

---

## Repository Overview

The goal of this repository is to explore statistical distributions and data analysis:

- **Normal Distribution (`normal.ipynb`)**: Simulates a dataset of weights to illustrate how data clusters around the mean and spreads according to standard deviation.  
- **Multivariate Normal Distribution (`multivariate.ipynb`)**: Simulates weight and height data to demonstrate relationships between multiple variables and visualizes correlations using scatter plots.

## 📄 Notebooks Description

### 1. `normal.ipynb`
- Generates a large dataset following a **Normal distribution**.
- Computes statistics like minimum, maximum, and bin width for histograms.
- Visualizes the distribution using **Matplotlib**.

### 2. `multivariate.ipynb`
- Generates datasets for **weight and height**.
- Demonstrates **correlation** and normal distribution of multiple variables.
- Visualizes relationships using **scatter plots** with Matplotlib.
- Uses **Pandas** for data handling and analysis.
